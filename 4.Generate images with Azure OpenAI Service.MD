## What is DALL-E?
* DALL-E is a neural network based model that can generate graphical data from natural language input. 
* Put more simply, you can provide DALL-E with a description and it can generate an appropriate image.
* For example, you might submit the following natural language prompt to DALL-E: A squirrel on a motorcycle
* This prompt could result in the generation of graphical output such as the following image:
* <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/generate-images-azure-openai/media/squirrel-on-motorcycle.png" height=100 width=100>
* The images generated by DALL-E are original; they are not retrieved from a curated image catalog. 
* In other words, DALL-E is not a search system for finding appropriate images - it is an AI model that generates new images based on the data on which it was trained.

## Explore DALL-E in Azure AI Studio
* To experiment with DALL-E, use the Images playground to submit prompts and view the resulting generated images.

* When using the playground, you can adjust the settings to specify:
  1. The resolution (size) of the generated images. Available sizes are 1024x1024 (which is the default value), 1792x1024, or 1024x1792.
  1. The image style to be generated (such as vivid or natural).
  1. The image quality (choose from standard or hd).

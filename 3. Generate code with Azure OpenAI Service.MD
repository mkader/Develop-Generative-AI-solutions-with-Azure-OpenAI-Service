## Construct code from natural language
* One of the capabilities of Azure OpenAI models is to generate code from NL prompts. 
* Tasks can range from a simple one line command to a full application. 
* The AI models can also edit and update provided code or previous responses to complete the requested task.

### Write functions
* Azure OpenAI models can create functions and apps in several languages by just describing what you want. Given the prompt "write a function for binary search in python", you likely receive a response with the function and an explanation of the code.
```
def binary_search(array, target):  
    low = 0  
    high = len(array) - 1  
  
    while low <= high:  
        mid = (low + high) // 2  
        if array[mid] == target:  
            return mid  
        elif array[mid] < target:  
            low = mid + 1  
        else:  
            high = mid - 1  
  
    return -1  
```
### Change coding language
* If you have code in one language, but need it in another, Azure OpenAI can translate that for you. For example, say you have this print_squares function in Python.
```
Python
def print_squares(n):  
    for i in range(1, n+1):  
        print(i**2)   

If you provide that code, along with the prompt convert this code to C#, you likely get something similar to the following function.

C#
public void PrintSquares(int n)  
{  
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine(i * i);  
    }  
}  
```

### Understand unknown code
* Azure OpenAI models are helpful for understanding code that doesn't make sense, or may be in a language you aren't familiar with. For example, say you were given the following function (in a fictitious coding language!) and didn't know how to understand it.
```
fn qzplv(n: i32, m: i32) -> i32 {
    if n == 0 {
        return m + 1;
    } else if m == 0 {
        return qzplv(n - 1, 1);
    } else {
        return qzplv(n - 1, qzplv(n, m - 1));
    }
}
```
* When provided to the model, along with the prompt could you explain what this code is doing?, you get a response similar to the following:
```
Sure, I'd be happy to explain what this code is doing!
....
```

## What is generative AI?
* People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. One popular example of such an application is MS Copilot, 
* Generative AI applications take in NL input, and return appropriate responses in a variety of formats such as natural language, images, or code.

* Natural language generation

* Image generation
  1. Some generative AI applications can interpret a NL request and generate an appropriate image. For example, you might submit a request like "Create a logo for a florist business."
  1. A generative AI application could then return an original new image based on the description you provided, like this:

* Code generation
  1. Some generative AI applications are designed to help software developers write code. 
  1. For example, you could submit a request like "Write Python code to add two numbers." and generate the following response: def add_numbers(a, b): return a + b
